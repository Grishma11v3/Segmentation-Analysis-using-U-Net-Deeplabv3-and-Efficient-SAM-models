Segmentation Analysis of Prompting Data: Comprehensive Study of UNet, DeepLabv3+ and Efficient SAM Models

This paper presents a comprehensive study investigating various segmentation models and techniques, aiming to enhance object segmentation accuracy. Specifically, we focus on employing the UNET and DeepLABV3+ segmentation models to improve object segmentation compared to conventional techniques. Our evaluation encompasses diverse datasets with corresponding masks, enabling a thorough comparison of model performance. Additionally, we introduce an innovative approach aimed at reducing the number of annotations required for predicting the mask by incorporating the efficient SAM. Through this comparative analysis, we assess the efficacy of UNET and DeepLABV3+ in accurately segmenting objects, providing insights into their applicability and potential advancements in the field of computer vision. Furthermore, we propose an efficient model capable of achieving high accuracy while minimizing the number of prompts required for annotation.
