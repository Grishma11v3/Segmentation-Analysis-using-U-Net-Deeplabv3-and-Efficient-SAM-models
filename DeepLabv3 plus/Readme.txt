We have integrated DeepLabV3+ with ResNet50v2, which is added as the backbone network in the DeepLabV3+ architecture. We chose this architecture with an idea to leverage the powerful feature extraction capabilities of ResNet50v2 and sophisticated semantic segmentation architecture of DeepLabv3+ in our model. We have trained and tested this model with provided 16 datasets and prompting results.
